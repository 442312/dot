### My favorite minimal debian install
Created on Debian 10 and then updated to Debian sid

![screenshot minimal debian i3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/442312/dot/master/custom-s/kterm-i3/screenshot20210826.png)

Distro: Debian sid
DM: no (xinitrc)
WM: i3
Terminal: urxvt
File manager: thunar
Editor: geany, vim

File [installed_packages](https://github.com/442312/dot/blob/master/custom-s/kterm-i3/installed_packages) contains all packages, installed in the system. To batch install them use [this](https://github.com/442312/dot/blob/master/Install_packages_from_file.md) instruction.

I like this setup very much, but now whant to make something different. Push it here to not forget how it was made.
